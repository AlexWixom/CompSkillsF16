# Homework 9: ****DRAFT**** 

**NOTE: This is not the actual assignment yet!** I'm posting it for those of you who might want to get started anyway.

In this assignment gives you will make plots from the OTU relative abundances and metadata from previous assignments. 

## Things to Do by midnight, **12/1**, or Sooner ##

Write a program called *plots.py* that uses matplotlib to create some plots/charts to analyze microbiome data from previous assignments (do what you need to to get the data into a usable format). For each of these, either turn in all work in a jupyter notebook or create separate png files named *stacked.png* and *diversity.png* (respectively for each step 1--2 below.)

1. Make horizontal stacked barcharts of each woman's microbiome that looks like this (pay attention to titles and axis lables)

2. Make dot plots of average diversity indexes by women

## Turn in homework
1. Commit your work
2. Update your local master
3. Sync with the remote master (that is how we will turn in homework!).
## Grading
Grades will be determined as follows:

Grade | Criteria 
-------- | --------------
0          | Nothing turned in
1          | *plots.py*  turned in but doesn't run, or is incorrect
2          | *plots.py* accurate and figures correctly formatted
3          | Code uses good style
