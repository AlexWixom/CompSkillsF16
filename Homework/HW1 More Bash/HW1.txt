Write a bash script named ~/CompSkills_F16/Homework/HW1/<yourname>/about-sequences that does the following:
output the text “<yourname>, summary of about-sequences”
output the full file information (from ls -l) about ~/CompSkills_F16/Homework/Resources

Uses grep and wc to output the number of fasta records in ~/CompSkills_F16/Homework/Resources/HW1-sequences.fsa
